/**
 * Mem Block
 * A block object which is essentially a "placeholder"
 * for a full {@link Block} object. The v8 garbage
 * collector's head will explode if there is too much
 * data on the javascript heap. Blocks can currently
 * be up to 1mb in size. In the future, they may be
 * 2mb, 8mb, or maybe 20mb, who knows? A MemBlock
 * is an optimization which defers parsing of
 * the serialized transactions (the block Buffer) until
 * the block has passed through the chain queue and
 * is about to enter the chain. This keeps a lot data
 * off of the javascript heap for most of the time a
 * block even exists in memory, and manages to keep a
 * lot of strain off of the garbage collector. Having
 * 500mb of blocks on the js heap would not be a good
 * thing.
